# ABACUS SPA TEST: REVISED
This is an update to the Abacus SPA Test. The Layout looks better and the Fulltext Search was also implemented.
However, I created some Mock Data that are fetched via REST. Not exactly the same Structure as the Original but it works.
See also the DB-Schema and a few Screenshots in the `-SCREENSHOTS-` Folder. I could not help it.... I just have to get it done... perhaps that's just me...
Another point to note is that there is also no Authentication for the the REST API... I did that on purpose since it is not really part ot the exercise :-)

## INSTALLATION + USAGE HINTS
Simply run `npm install` on the cloned package.
Once NPM finishes installing all the necessary Dependencies, run `npm run serve`
That's all! Afterwards, you may want to navigate to `http//:localhost:8080` - assuming that port is Free.
